# Problem solving patterns

what are:
frequency counters, two pointer problems and divide and conquer

## Common steps to solving a problem

1. Understand the problem (setup constrains)
2. Export Concrete Examples (experience)
3. Break it down to smaller chunks
4. Solve/Simplify
5. Reflex and Refactor

## 1. Understand the problem

Questions To Ask:

1. Can I repeat the question asked in my own words, do I understand what the task is?

2. What are the inputs that go into the problem (ie. negative numbers ? null numbers ?)

3. What are the outputs that come out the solution ?

4. Can the output be determined from the input? Do I have all the information to solve the question?

5. How should I label the data(variable, function, results) to solve this problem?
